COURSE 1: INTRODUCTION TO DEEP LEARNING
WEEK 2: NEURAL NETWORKS BASICS

+ Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
+ Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
+ Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
+ Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
+ Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
+ Work with iPython Notebooks
+ Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
+ Explain the concept of broadcasting
